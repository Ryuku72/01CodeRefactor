<H2>Meeting Expectations </h2>
<H3>Sematic and Sequential Order of Elements (HTML & CSS)</H3>
<H4>HTML<H4>
<P> There was a heavy use of Div throughout the code sequence. This was converted to a more semantic structure sequence of Header, figure, section, aside and footer. The 'Hero' img element was moved between line 32 - 34 for clear sequence order of elements. Added addition notes between each root elements for clarity.</p>
<br>
<H4>CSS</H4>
<P>All changes to the div's were translated to the cascading style sheet (header, figure, section, aside, footer). Notes were applied to clarify each root element. Hero class was moved further up the css to reflect the order of the corresponding html index.</p>
<br>
<H3>Logical Structure independent of style</h3>
<H4>HTML</h4>
<p>Only major change to the html structure is the 'Hero' img element. Turning off the stylesheet will flow in the correct order of header, figure, section, aside and footer. Additional note, Image sizes are extremely large without style restrictions</p>
<br>
<H3>ALT element</H3>
<Html>
<p> Alt elements was added to every img src attribute. Larger pictures were given a discription which icons were simply named after the icons they represent </p>
<br>
<H3>Concise Title</H3>
<h4>HTML</h4>
<p>Title was changed to 'Horiseon | Social Solutions' in reflection to the footer '2019 Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.'</p> 
<Br>
<H3>Fix Links</H3>
<H4>HTML</H4>
<P>The link for '#search-engine-optimization' did not work because the corresponding ID did not exist. This was inserted on line 40.</p>
